 *  @brief Reconstructor.h contains a 2D and 3D model reconstruction class. For 2D reconstruction, it provides all functions that are used for reconstructing a 2D Fourier transform of a 2D modal in 2D Fourier space from the pixel data of 2D Fourier transform of real images and the associated 5D coordinates which are learned from sampling in the former round. For 3D reconstruction, it provides all functions that are used for reconstructing a 3D Fourier transform of a 3D model in 3D Fourier space from the pixel data of 2D Fourier transform of real images and the associated 5D coordinates which are learned from sampling in the former round. Apart from the ordinary CPU-version functions, it also provides several GPU-version insert functions.

/**
 * @brief The 2D and 3D model reconstruction class. 
 * It provides all APIs that are used for reconstructing a 2D/3D Fourier transform of a 2D/3D model in 2D/3D Fourier space from the pixel data of 2D Fourier transform of real images and the associated 5D coordinates which are learned from sampling in the former round. 
 * According to the central section theorem, the Fourier transform of a specific projection of a 3D model onto a 2D plane is equal to the 2D slice of the 3D Fourier transform of that model consisting of a 2D plane through the origin in the Fourier space which is parallel to the projection plane. So each Fourier transform of the images should be a slice of 3D Fourier transform of the protein in the 3D Fourier space. 
 * By inserting the Fourier transform of the images into an empty volume with correct 5D coordinates in 3D Fourier space, the 3D Fourier transform of the protein can be reconstructed as similar as the original one. 
 * Since slices inserted into the 3D empty volume all go through the origin in 3D Fourier space, the value at site near the origin will be affected by comparatively more slices than that far from the origin. It is necessary to balance the value at different site in 3D Fourier space. Using weights, we reduce the scale of value at site near origin and increase the scale of value at site far from the origin. 
 * Simultaneously, normalization is done to make sure the value at every site is proper in 3D Fourier space.
